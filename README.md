# Knowledge Base Module for Sharework
This repository contains a ROSjava package enriching ROS with knowledge representation and reasoning services. The module has been specifically designed for Human-Robot Collaboration manufacturing.

The main component of the module is the ProductionKnowledge which is in charge of semantically represent and reason about information characterizing HRC processes, collaborative tasks as well as contextualie human and robot capabilities. A number of ROS services are built on top of this component to 

The semantic representation of HRC dynamics relies on the ontolofical framework SOHO [1] while the developed reasoning functionalities have been realized using the open-source software library Apache Jena (https://jena.apache.org/).
